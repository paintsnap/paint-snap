Here’s a full, clear prompt you can copy-paste into the Replit AI agent to generate the updated **PaintSnap** structure. It balances structure with flexibility so the agent knows exactly what to do:

**📝 Full Replit Agent Prompt:**

> I'm building an app called **PaintSnap**. It lets users take or upload a photo of a room, surface, or object and tag features in that photo with details like the paint used.  
> 
> The structure is:  
> - One fixed project called **"Your Project"**  
> - Under that, users create **Areas** (e.g. “Living Room”, “Front of House”)  
> - Each Area contains **Photos**  
> - Each Photo contains **Tags**
>
> ### Here's how the app should work:
> 1. On the **Home screen**, show a list of Areas. Each Area card should have a kebab menu (three dots) with options: Rename Area, Delete Area.
> 2. Include an “Add Area” button at the top or bottom.
> 3. When the user clicks **Add** in the bottom navigation, they should be prompted to:
>    - Select an existing Area from a dropdown
>    - Upload a new Photo
>    - The photo should be saved under that Area
> 4. When viewing an Area, show a list of Photos inside it.
>    - Each Photo should have a kebab menu with: Rename Photo, Delete Photo, Move to another Area.
> 5. When a Photo is tapped, open it full-screen in a Photo Viewer.
>    - Users can tap anywhere on the image to add a Tag.
>    - Each Tag has:
>        - Description (short label)
>        - Details (e.g. paint name/type)
>        - Notes (e.g. when it was last painted)
>        - Optional photo upload (e.g. image of the paint tin)
>    - Tags should display as pins or small dots on the image. Tapping a pin opens a modal or sidebar with the tag details.
> 6. Add a **Bottom Navigation bar** with three buttons:
>    - Home: takes user to the Areas list
>    - Add: opens the new photo upload flow (select Area + upload photo)
>    - All: shows all Photos across all Areas (grid or list)
>
> I’m currently using Replit’s database and login system. Please structure the app so users only see their own data. The app only needs to support **one project** at this time ("Your Project") — multiple projects and export PDF will be for a future paid tier.
